## Brain Dynamics Toolbox
The **Brain Dynamics Toolbox** is open matlab software for exploring user-defined dynamical systems with minimal programming effort. It solves initial-value problems in systems of ODEs, DDEs, SDEs and PDEs. Users define their system of equations as a custom matlab function. Interchangeable solvers and graphical plotting tools can then be applied to it with no additional programming effort. The toolbox is available from [bdtoolbox.org](https://bdtoolbox.org).

## Cardiac Safety Pharmacology
The *axis of arrhythmia* is a conceptual framework we devised to predict the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. The axis quantifies how different combinations of ion channel blockade in cardiac cells influence arrhythmogenic potential, offering a standardised method for drug safety assessment. Recently, we showed that the axis can be derived independently from both (i) biophysical computer simulations, and (ii) statistical analysis of pharmacological drug datasets. It is a lovely example of a simple idea that bridges the gap between complex biophysical models and black-box statistical models.

## Arrhythmogenesis as the failure of repolarization
Atrial fibrillation typically arises from the anatomical site where the pulmonary veins attach to the heart wall. Nobody knows why. We used dynamical systems theory to show that arrhythmias can be triggered by cardiac cells that fail to repolarize of their own accord. Technically, these cells are said to be *bistable* because they can dwell in either the resting state or the depolarized state. 

![Bistable Action Potentials](BistableActionPotentials.png "Bistable Action Potentials"){: .my-image70}

Our analysis showed that the heart can support normal travelling waves despite the presence of large numbers of bistable cells. However there is a limit and tissue boundaries are especially susceptible to arrhthymia. This may explain why atrial fibrillation often emanates from the cuff of the pulmonary vein.

## Direction-selective visual motion detection
Neurons of the visual cortex are known to respond selectively to the direction of visual motion. Mathematically, the response characteristics of the neurons cannot be constructed from separate spatial and temporal processes. It is unknown how these neurons work without resort to explicit time delays in the circuitry. 

![Visual Motion Detection](VisualMotionFig1.png "Visual Motion Detection"){: .my-image50} 

We proposed a novel neural mechanism that relies on travelling waves in the cortical tissue insetad of time delays. We showed that endogenously generated waves can resonate with the space-time signature of the visual stimulus to selectively respond to visual motion. The speed and direction of the waves are governed entirely by the profile of the lateral-inhibitory coupling.

## The mathematics of brain stimulation

Optogenetic techniques allow neurophysiologists to directly stimulate neurons with light. It is often assumed that the dynamical behaviour of the neural tissue is unchanged. However recent observations provide a clue that this may not be the case. Lu et al (2015) found that stimulation of macaque cortex elicited 40-80 Hz oscillations that were consistent with Type II neural excitability. Yet these oscillations propagated far into the surrounding cortical tissue. Whereas mathematical theory suggests that propagating waves are only supported by neural tissue with Type I excitability. So how can cortical tissue simultaneously exhibit both Type I and Type II excitability? 
We investigated the apparent contradiction by modelling the cortex as recurrently-connected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We found that optogenetic stimulation can locally transform Type I excitability into Type II excitability by preferentially targeting inhibitory cells. The findings shed new light on how optogenetic stimulation can alter the response dynamics of neural tissue.

## The cortical origin of visual hallucinations

Geometric patterns of spirals, honeycombs and checker-boards are common themes in visual hallucinations. They are thought to originate from the neural circuitry of the primary visual cortex -- the region of the brain which processes visual shapes.

Our collaborators at the University of New South Wales devised a method for objectively measuring the visual hallucinations seen in stroboscopic flicker. In particular, they measured the spatial wavelength and speed of illusory blobs that appear to race around a ring-shaped stimulus when it is flickered at 10-20 Hz. As part of this study, we constructed a mathematical model of the visual cortex that reproduces the perceptual behaviour.

## Pattern formation in neural oscillators

The prevalence of synchronized neural spiking in the brain suggests a role in normal brain function. Neural synchronization can be modelled with coupled oscillators where the phase of each oscillator represents the timing of the neural spike. These models generate planar waves and spirals which resemble those observed in neural tissue.

## Motor commands as spatial oscillation patterns

Beta-band (15-30 Hz) neural oscillations are routinely observed in the human motor system but their purpose is unknown. We conjectured that the spatial arrangement of beta oscillations in cortex could serves as the neural substrate for encoding motor commands. We constructed a model of the descending motor system which shows how oscillatory patterns in cortex can be translated into specific muscle movements. The model demonstrates a functional role for beta oscillations that also replicates the known physiological changes of beta-band cortico-muscular coherence during movement.

## Co-contraction of antagonist muscles

Co-contraction refers to the simultaneous contraction of antagonist muscles. It has no impact on joint torque but it does increase joint damping because of the non-linear force-velocity properties of muscle tissue. We analysed the stability of co-contracting muscle in a simulated biomechanical limb with realistic force-length-velocity relationships. We found that co-contraction not only modulates joint damping but that it also effects postural stability. Under certain conditions, co-contracting muscles can even induce multiple stable equilibrium points.
